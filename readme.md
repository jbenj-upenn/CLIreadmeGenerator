The purpose of this project is to develop an easy-to-use README generator for other developers. Various questions prompt the user, using her/his feedback in the README itself. 

Initially, I sought to actually use the generator to create this README. Please see "README1.md" for those results. Albeit a failed attempt, there are a number of categories that remain relevant, including the Contributing section. Look each one of these coders up on github.com: Meguel Chavez, Erik Donovan, Kevin Diesel, Artan "Tani" Muzhaqi.

CONTRIBUTE:

I invite any and all coders to jump in here and steer me straight. At this point, however, my brain is no longer functioning and I'm leaving well-enough alone. 

SCREENSHOTS are found below. For a GIF of the code working in VS Code's terminal, please click into the assets folder and have a look.
