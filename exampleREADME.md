# Project title
# This is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) README Generator

# Description
I build this to help users create quick and efficient README documents by simply answering a series of questions.

# Installation
Inquire, Dotenv

# Usage
The project will be used by developers who may be in a rush and need a very fast template for making a README file. They can simply fill in their answers here, and just like that, a README is generated.
